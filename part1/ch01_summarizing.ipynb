    "# 1.3 Summarizing 1D Data\n",
    "\n",
    "After visualizing data, we need numerical summaries to describe datasets quantitatively. This section covers fundamental descriptive statistics that allow us to characterize location (where the data is centered) and scale (how spread out the data is).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3.1 The Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The **mean** (or average) is the most common measure of central tendency. It represents the \"center of mass\" of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dataset $\\{x\\}$ of $N$ data items $x_1, \\ldots, x_N$, the mean is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{mean}(\\{x\\}) = \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of the Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean has several important mathematical properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Property 1.1: Translation and Scaling**\n",
    "- $\\text{mean}(\\{x + c\\}) = \\text{mean}(\\{x\\}) + c$\n",
    "- $\\text{mean}(\\{kx\\}) = k \\cdot \\text{mean}(\\{x\\})$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Property: Sum of Deviations**\n",
    "- The sum of deviations from the mean equals zero: $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0$\n",

    "### Worked Example: Bar Net Worth\n",
    "\n",
    "Ten people in a bar have the following net worths (in dollars):\n",

    "| Measure | Formula | Robust? | Use When |\n",
    "|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n",
    "| Mean | $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum x_i$ | No | Symmetric data, no outliers |\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean vs Median**: Use median for skewed data or when outliers are present\n",
    "2. **Standard Deviation**: Measures typical deviation from mean; sensitive to outliers\n",
    "3. **IQR**: Robust measure of spread; good for data with outliers\n",
    "4. **Z-scores**: Standardize data for comparison across different scales\n",
    "5. **Precision matters**: Don't report meaningless digits\n",
    "6. **Categorical data**: Prefer median and percentiles over mean\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Try calculating these statistics for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test scores**: [85, 92, 78, 90, 88, 95, 100, 72, 86, 91]\n",
    "   - Mean, median, std dev, IQR\n",
    "   - Compare mean vs median\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Income data** (deliberately skewed): [45000, 52000, 48000, 51000, 2500000, 46000, 49000]\n",
    "   - Why is median better than mean here?\n",
    "   - Calculate both and compare\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heights** (in cm): [165, 170, 168, 172, 175, 171, 169, 173, 166, 174]\n",
    "   - Convert to z-scores\n",
    "   - Which heights are more than 1 std dev from mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
