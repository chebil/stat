    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean vs Median**: Use median for skewed data or when outliers are present\n",
    "2. **Standard Deviation**: Measures typical deviation from mean; sensitive to outliers\n",
    "3. **IQR**: Robust measure of spread; good for data with outliers\n",
    "4. **Z-scores**: Standardize data for comparison across different scales\n",
    "5. **Precision matters**: Don't report meaningless digits\n",
    "6. **Categorical data**: Prefer median and percentiles over mean\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Try calculating these statistics for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test scores**: [85, 92, 78, 90, 88, 95, 100, 72, 86, 91]\n",
    "   - Mean, median, std dev, IQR\n",
    "   - Compare mean vs median\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Income data** (deliberately skewed): [45000, 52000, 48000, 51000, 2500000, 46000, 49000]\n",
    "   - Why is median better than mean here?\n",
    "   - Calculate both and compare\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heights** (in cm): [165, 170, 168, 172, 175, 171, 169, 173, 166, 174]\n",
    "   - Convert to z-scores\n",
    "   - Which heights are more than 1 std dev from mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Continue to [1.4 Plots and Summaries](ch01_plots_summaries.md) to learn about combining visualizations with these numerical summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ See [Chapter 2: Looking at Relationships](chapter02.md) for analyzing relationships between variables."
