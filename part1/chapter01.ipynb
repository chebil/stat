    "# Chapter 1: First Tools for Looking at Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The single most important question for a working scientist is: **\"What's going on here?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces fundamental techniques for exploring and understanding datasets through visualization and summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand what datasets are and how they're structured\n",
    "- Create effective visualizations (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots)\n",
    "- Calculate and interpret descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)\n",
    "- Use standard coordinates and recognize normal data\n",
    "- Apply these tools to real-world datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Datasets**: Collections of observations or measurements\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Making pictures of data to expose structure\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics**: Numerical summaries of datasets\n",
    "- **Distribution**: How data values are spread across possible values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "- [1.1 Datasets](ch01_datasets.md)\n",
    "- [1.2 Plotting Data](ch01_plotting.md)\n",
    "- [1.3 Summarizing 1D Data](ch01_summarizing.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into complex statistical methods, you need to understand your data. Visualization and descriptive statistics are your first line of defense against:\n",
    "- Hidden patterns\n",
    "- Outliers\n",
    "- Data quality issues\n",
    "- Misleading conclusions\n",
