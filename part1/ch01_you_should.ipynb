    "### Properties of the Mean\n",
    "1. Scaling data scales the mean: $\\text{mean}(\\{kx_i\\}) = k \\cdot \\text{mean}(\\{x_i\\})$\n",
    "2. Translating data translates the mean: $\\text{mean}(\\{x_i + c\\}) = \\text{mean}(\\{x_i\\}) + c$\n",
    "3. Sum of deviations from mean is zero: $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\text{mean}(\\{x_i\\})) = 0$\n",
    "4. The mean minimizes sum of squared distances: $\\text{argmin}_a \\sum_i (x_i - a)^2 = \\text{mean}(\\{x\\})$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Standard Deviation\n",
    "1. Translation doesn't change std: $\\text{std}(\\{x_i + c\\}) = \\text{std}(\\{x_i\\})$\n",
    "2. Scaling scales std: $\\text{std}(\\{kx_i\\}) = |k| \\cdot \\text{std}(\\{x_i\\})$\n",
    "3. At most $\\frac{1}{k^2}$ of data can be k or more standard deviations from the mean\n",
    "4. At least one data point must be at least one standard deviation from the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Variance\n",
    "1. $\\text{var}(\\{x + c\\}) = \\text{var}(\\{x\\})$\n",
    "2. $\\text{var}(\\{kx\\}) = k^2 \\cdot \\text{var}(\\{x\\})$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Median\n",
    "1. $\\text{median}(\\{x + c\\}) = \\text{median}(\\{x\\}) + c$\n",
    "2. $\\text{median}(\\{kx\\}) = k \\cdot \\text{median}(\\{x\\})$\n",
    "3. Median is robust to outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Standard Coordinates\n",
    "1. $\\text{mean}(\\{\\tilde{x}\\}) = 0$\n",
    "2. $\\text{std}(\\{\\tilde{x}\\}) = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Normal Data\n",
    "For normal data:\n",
    "- About 68% lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean\n",
    "- About 95% lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean\n",
    "- About 99.7% lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **68-95-99.7 rule** or **empirical rule**.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Compute** percentiles and quartiles\n",
    "3. **Convert** data to standard coordinates (z-scores)\n",
    "4. **Identify** outliers using the IQR method (values < Q1 - 1.5×IQR or > Q3 + 1.5×IQR)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization Skills\n",
    "1. **Create** bar charts for categorical data\n",
    "2. **Create** histograms for continuous data\n",
    "3. **Create** conditional histograms to compare subgroups\n",
    "4. **Create** box plots to compare distributions\n",
    "5. **Interpret** these visualizations to understand data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Skills\n",
    "1. **Identify** whether data is skewed (left, right, or symmetric)\n",
    "2. **Determine** if data is unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal\n",
    "3. **Choose** appropriate summary statistics (mean vs. median, std vs. IQR)\n",
    "4. **Recognize** when data appears to be normally distributed\n",
    "5. **Compare** multiple datasets using appropriate visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "1. **Explain** why mean is sensitive to outliers but median is not\n",
    "2. **Explain** why standard deviation measures spread\n",
    "3. **Explain** what standard coordinates achieve\n",
