    "# 1.4 Plots and Summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range of a dataset gives us some information about what its histogram might look like. The summaries give us a language to describe characteristic properties of histograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4.1 Some Properties of Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tails and Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "The **tails** of a histogram are the relatively uncommon values that are significantly larger (resp. smaller) than the value at the peak (which is sometimes called the **mode**).\n",
    "\n",
    "A histogram is **unimodal** if there is only one peak; if there are more than one, it is **multimodal**, with the special term **bimodal** sometimes being used for the case where there are two peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "The histograms we have seen have been relatively **symmetric**, where the left and right tails are about as long as one another. Not all data is symmetric. In some datasets, one or another tail is longer. This effect is called **skew**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skew appears often in real data.** For example, consider a dataset of citations to faculty publications. Generally, a small number of papers get many citations, and many papers get few citations. These histograms are very different from, say, body temperature pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Right-Skewed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In **right-skewed** (or positively skewed) data:\n",
    "- There are many small data items\n",
    "- A small number of data items are large\n",
    "- The right tail is longer\n",
    "- Mean > Median\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common causes**:\n",
    "- Income data (always positive, but can be very large)\n",
    "- Citation counts\n",
    "- Website traffic\n",
    "- Constrained minimums\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Left-Skewed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In **left-skewed** (or negatively skewed) data:\n",
    "- There are many large data items\n",
    "- Some data items are small\n",
    "- The left tail is longer\n",
    "- Mean < Median\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common causes**:\n",
    "- Test scores with ceiling effects\n",
    "- Birth weights (obstetrical practice prevents very large babies)\n",
    "- Age at death (in developed countries)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking for Skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 1**: Look at the histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 2**: Compare mean and median\n",
    "- If mean >> median: likely right-skewed\n",
    "- If mean << median: likely left-skewed\n",
    "- If mean ≈ median: likely symmetric"

    "   - Skewness (left, right, symmetric)\n",
    "   - How to identify these features\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standard coordinates**:\n",
    "   - Normalize data for comparison\n",
    "   - Mean = 0, Std = 1\n",
    "   - Reveals underlying distribution shape\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normal data**:\n",
    "   - Bell-shaped histogram in standard coordinates\n",
    "   - 68-95-99.7 rule\n",
    "   - Many real datasets are approximately normal\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Box plots**:\n",
    "   - Compact visual summary\n",
    "   - Easy comparison of multiple groups\n",
    "   - Shows median, quartiles, and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools help you understand \"what's going on\" in your data before performing more sophisticated analyses.\n",

    "## Practice Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate right-skewed and left-skewed data. Verify that mean > median for right-skewed and mean < median for left-skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take any dataset and:\n",
    "   - Compute z-scores\n",
    "   - Verify mean(z-scores) = 0 and std(z-scores) = 1\n",
    "   - Plot histogram of z-scores\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Generate normal data with mean=50, std=10:\n",
    "   - Check the 68-95-99.7 rule\n",
    "   - What percentage falls within 1.5 standard deviations?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create box plots for exam scores from 3 different classes. Identify which class:\n",
    "   - Has the highest median\n",
    "   - Has the most spread\n",
    "   - Has the most outliers\n",
