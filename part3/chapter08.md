# Chapter 8: Experiments

This chapter covers **experimental design** and **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** - methods for comparing multiple groups and understanding how factors affect outcomes.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Design and analyze simple experiments
- Understand factorial experimental designs
- Perform one-way ANOVA
- Conduct two-way ANOVA with interaction effects
- Interpret F-tests and post-hoc comparisons
- Apply randomization and blocking principles
- Recognize when ANOVA assumptions are violated

## Chapter Outline

1. **Simple Experiments** - One-way ANOVA and randomized designs
2. **Two-Factor Experiments** - Two-way ANOVA with interactions
3. **Experimental Design Principles** - Randomization, replication, blocking

## Why This Matters

Experimental design and ANOVA are essential for:
- **Scientific Research**: Testing multiple treatments simultaneously
- **Product Development**: Optimizing multiple factors
- **Agriculture**: Comparing crop varieties and conditions
- **Manufacturing**: Quality improvement experiments
- **Psychology**: Understanding effects of multiple variables

## The Core Question

> "Do different treatments lead to different outcomes?"

ANOVA provides a rigorous framework for answering this when comparing **more than two groups**.
