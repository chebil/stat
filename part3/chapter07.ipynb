    "# Chapter 7: The Significance of Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces **hypothesis testing** - a formal framework for making decisions based on data. We learn how to evaluate whether observed patterns are likely due to chance or represent real effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses\n",
    "- Understand and compute p-values\n",
    "- Conduct t-tests for comparing means\n",
    "- Apply F-tests for comparing variances\n",
    "- Use chi-square tests for categorical data\n",
    "- Interpret statistical significance correctly\n",
    "- Avoid common pitfalls (p-hacking, multiple testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Significance and P-Values** - The foundation of hypothesis testing\n",
    "2. **Comparing Means** - t-tests for one and two samples\n",
    "3. **Other Important Tests** - F-tests and chi-square tests\n",
    "4. **Dangers and Pitfalls** - What can go wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is fundamental to:\n",
    "- **Scientific Research**: Validating experimental findings\n",
    "- **A/B Testing**: Making data-driven product decisions\n",
    "- **Quality Control**: Detecting process changes\n",
    "- **Medicine**: Evaluating treatment effectiveness\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: Comparing model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Big Question\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Could this result have happened by chance?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing provides a rigorous framework for answering this question.\n",
