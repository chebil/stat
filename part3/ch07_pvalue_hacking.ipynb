    "\n",
    "**P-hacking** (also called \"data dredging\" or \"significance chasing\") refers to manipulating data analysis until statistical significance is achieved. This can be done:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selectively reporting outcomes** — Testing many outcomes but only reporting significant ones\n",
    "2. **Stopping data collection when significant** — Checking significance repeatedly and stopping when p < 0.05\n",
    "3. **Trying multiple tests** — Analyzing data many ways and reporting the one that works\n",
    "4. **Removing \"outliers\" strategically** — Excluding data points that hurt significance\n",
    "5. **Subgroup analysis** — Splitting data into groups until finding a significant effect\n",
    "6. **Changing hypotheses post-hoc** — Switching from two-sided to one-sided tests, or changing the null hypothesis after seeing data\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Multiple Comparisons Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: Testing multiple hypotheses inflates the chance of finding at least one \"significant\" result by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Testing if 10 drugs work using α = 0.05 for each test:\n",
    "- Probability of at least one false positive ≈ $1 - (1-0.05)^{10} \\approx 0.40$\n",
    "- Even if no drugs work, there's a 40% chance of declaring at least one \"effective\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "- **Bonferroni correction**: Use $\\alpha/m$ for each of $m$ tests\n",
    "  - If testing 10 hypotheses, use $\\alpha = 0.05/10 = 0.005$ for each\n",
    "  - Conservative but protects against false positives\n",
    "- **Holm-Bonferroni**: Less conservative sequential method\n",
    "- **False Discovery Rate (FDR)**: Control expected proportion of false positives\n",
    "- **Pre-specify primary outcome**: Designate one main hypothesis before data collection\n",

    "\n",
    "### Before Data Collection\n",
    "1. **Pre-register your study**\n",
    "   - Specify hypotheses, sample size, analysis plan\n",
    "   - Platforms: OSF, AsPredicted, ClinicalTrials.gov\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Plan sample size** using power analysis\n",
    "   - Don't stop when you reach significance\n",
    "   - Don't continue indefinitely seeking significance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Designate primary outcome**\n",
    "   - Specify ONE main hypothesis\n",
    "   - Secondary analyses are exploratory\n",
    "\n",
    "### During Analysis\n",
    "4. **Analyze blinded when possible**\n",
    "   - Don't peek at results while making analytic decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use pre-specified analysis plan**\n",
    "   - Deviations are fine but should be noted\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Correct for multiple testing**\n",
    "   - Bonferroni, FDR, or pre-specify family-wise error rate\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Reporting\n",
    "7. **Report everything**\n",
    "   - All outcomes tested, not just significant ones\n",
    "   - All subgroups analyzed\n",
    "   - Any deviations from pre-registered plan\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Report effect sizes and confidence intervals**\n",
    "   - Not just p-values\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Distinguish confirmatory from exploratory**\n",
    "   - Be honest about what was planned vs. discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Share data and code**\n",
    "    - Allow others to reproduce your analysis\n",
