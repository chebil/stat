# Chapter 6: Samples and Populations

This chapter introduces **statistical inference** - the process of drawing conclusions about populations based on samples. We explore how sample statistics relate to population parameters and how to quantify the uncertainty in our estimates.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand the relationship between samples and populations
- Compute and interpret the sample mean as an estimator
- Calculate the variance and standard error of sample means
- Construct and interpret confidence intervals
- Apply the Central Limit Theorem to inference problems
- Use simulation to estimate standard errors

## Chapter Outline

1. **The Sample Mean** - Understanding sampling and estimation
2. **Confidence Intervals** - Quantifying uncertainty in estimates
3. **Practical Applications** - Real-world inference problems

## Why This Matters

Statistical inference is fundamental to:
- **Data Science**: Making predictions from data
- **Experimental Science**: Drawing conclusions from experiments
- **Quality Control**: Monitoring manufacturing processes
- **Survey Research**: Understanding populations from samples
- **Machine Learning**: Evaluating model performance

Let's begin by understanding how samples relate to populations.
