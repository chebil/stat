    "# Chapter 8: Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covers **experimental design** and **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** - methods for comparing multiple groups and understanding how factors affect outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design and analyze simple experiments\n",
    "- Understand factorial experimental designs\n",
    "- Perform one-way ANOVA\n",
    "- Conduct two-way ANOVA with interaction effects\n",
    "- Interpret F-tests and post-hoc comparisons\n",
    "- Apply randomization and blocking principles\n",
    "- Recognize when ANOVA assumptions are violated\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Experiments** - One-way ANOVA and randomized designs\n",
    "2. **Two-Factor Experiments** - Two-way ANOVA with interactions\n",
    "3. **Experimental Design Principles** - Randomization, replication, blocking\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental design and ANOVA are essential for:\n",
    "- **Scientific Research**: Testing multiple treatments simultaneously\n",
    "- **Product Development**: Optimizing multiple factors\n",
    "- **Agriculture**: Comparing crop varieties and conditions\n",
    "- **Manufacturing**: Quality improvement experiments\n",
    "- **Psychology**: Understanding effects of multiple variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Question\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Do different treatments lead to different outcomes?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA provides a rigorous framework for answering this when comparing **more than two groups**.\n",
