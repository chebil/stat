    "# Chapter 6: Samples and Populations\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces **statistical inference** - the process of drawing conclusions about populations based on samples. We explore how sample statistics relate to population parameters and how to quantify the uncertainty in our estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the relationship between samples and populations\n",
    "- Compute and interpret the sample mean as an estimator\n",
    "- Calculate the variance and standard error of sample means\n",
    "- Construct and interpret confidence intervals\n",
    "- Apply the Central Limit Theorem to inference problems\n",
    "- Use simulation to estimate standard errors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Sample Mean** - Understanding sampling and estimation\n",
    "2. **Confidence Intervals** - Quantifying uncertainty in estimates\n",
    "3. **Practical Applications** - Real-world inference problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical inference is fundamental to:\n",
    "- **Data Science**: Making predictions from data\n",
    "- **Experimental Science**: Drawing conclusions from experiments\n",
    "- **Quality Control**: Monitoring manufacturing processes\n",
    "- **Survey Research**: Understanding populations from samples\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: Evaluating model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by understanding how samples relate to populations."
