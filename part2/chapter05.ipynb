    "# Chapter 5: Useful Probability Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Most random phenomena we encounter fall into a small number of standard patterns. Rather than deriving probabilities from first principles every time, we can use **standard probability distributions**—well-studied functions that model common situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing these distributions is like having a toolkit:\n",
    "- Recognize patterns in real problems\n",
    "- Use established formulas instead of deriving from scratch\n",
    "- Leverage existing theory and computational tools\n",
    "- Communicate efficiently with other practitioners\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Study Probability Distributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider these scenarios:\n",
    "1. Number of heads in 100 coin flips\n",
    "2. Time until the next customer arrives\n",
    "3. Number of typos on a page\n",
    "4. Height of randomly selected person\n",
    "5. Number of failures before first success\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these follows a **named probability distribution** with known properties. Once you recognize the pattern, you immediately know:\n",
    "- The probability mass/density function\n",
    "- The expected value and variance\n",
    "- How to generate samples\n",
