    "We assume we have a space of outcomes $\\Omega$ and a collection of events. The **conditional probability** of $B$, conditioned on $A$, is the probability that $B$ occurs given that $A$ has definitely occurred. We write this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B|A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the examples, it should be clear to you that for some cases $P(B|A)$ is the same as $P(B)$, and for other cases it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4.1 Evaluating Conditional Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an expression for $P(B|A)$, notice that, because $A$ is known to have occurred, our space of outcomes (or sample space) is now **reduced to $A$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that our outcome lies in $A$. $P(B|A)$ is the probability that it also lies in $B \\cap A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome lies in $A$, and so it must lie in either $B \\cap A$ or in $B^c \\cap A$, and it cannot lie in both. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B|A) + P(B^c|A) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now recall the idea of probabilities as **relative frequencies**. If $P(C \\cap A) = kP(B \\cap A)$, this means that outcomes in $C \\cap A$ will appear $k$ times as often as outcomes in $B \\cap A$. But this must apply even if we know in advance that the outcome is in $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, if $P(C \\cap A) = kP(B \\cap A)$, then $P(C|A) = kP(B|A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In turn, we must have:\n",
    "$$P(B|A) \\propto P(B \\cap A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to determine the constant of proportionality (write $c$ for this constant), meaning:\n",
    "$$P(B|A) = cP(B \\cap A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have that:\n",
    "$$P(B|A) + P(B^c|A) = cP(B \\cap A) + cP(B^c \\cap A) = cP(A) = 1$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Size Metaphor\n",
    "\n",
    "I find the **size metaphor** helpful here. We have that $P(B|A)$ measures the probability that an outcome is in $B$, given we know it is in $A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the size perspective, $P(B|A)$ measures the **size of $(A \\cap B)$ relative to $A$**. So our expression makes sense, because the **fraction** of the event $A$ that is also part of the event $B$ is given by the size of the intersection divided by the size of $A$.\n",

    "$$P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula 2: Multiplication Rule\n",
    "Another, very useful, way to write the expression is:\n",
    "$$P(B|A)P(A) = P(B \\cap A)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since $B \\cap A = A \\cap B$, we must have:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is **Bayes' rule** (or Bayes' theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula 3: Law of Total Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $A$ and $A^c$ are disjoint sets, and that $B = (B \\cap A) \\cup (B \\cap A^c)$. So, because $P(B) = P(B \\cap A) + P(B \\cap A^c)$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assum we have a collection of disjoint sets $B_i$. These sets must have the property that:\n",
    "- (a) $B_i \\cap B_j = \\emptyset$ for $i \\neq j$ and\n",
    "- (b) they cover $A$, meaning that $A \\cap (\\bigcup_i B_i) = A$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, because $P(A) = \\sum_i P(A \\cap B_i)$, so we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{P(A) = \\sum_i P(A|B_i)P(B_i)}$$\n",

    "Here is one helpful example. If you buy a lottery ticket $L$, the probability of winning $W$ is small. So $P(W|L)$ may be very small. But $P(L|W) = 1$—the winner is always someone who bought a ticket!"

    "1. **Medical test**: Disease prevalence 0.01, sensitivity 0.99, specificity 0.95. Find $P(\\text{disease} | +\\text{test})$.\n",

    "2. **Cards**: Draw 2 cards without replacement. Given first is Ace, what is $P(\\text{second is King})$?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Monty Hall variant**: 4 doors, host opens 2 goat doors. Should you switch?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prosecutor's fallacy**: DNA match 1 in 1M, city has 8M people. Explain the fallacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Spam filter**: $P(\\text{spam}) = 0.3$, $P(\\text{\"free\"}|\\text{spam}) = 0.8$, $P(\\text{\"free\"}|\\text{not spam}) = 0.1$. Find $P(\\text{spam}|\\text{\"free\"})$.\n",
