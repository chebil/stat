    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independence**: $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$\n",
    "2. **Multiplication rule**: For independent events, multiply probabilities\n",
    "3. **Common mistake**: Gambler's fallacy\n",
    "4. **DNA databases**: Probability of false matches grows quickly\n",
    "5. **Airline overbooking**: Binomial probability application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Formula |\n",
    "|---------|--------|\n",
    "| Independence | $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ |\n",
    "| Multiple independent events | $P(A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n) = P(A_1) \\cdots P(A_n)$ |\n",
    "| Binomial probability | $P(k \\text{ successes in } n \\text{ trials}) = \\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Use when**:\n",
    "- Coin flips, dice rolls (different rolls)\n",
    "- Sampling with replacement\n",
    "- Truly random processes\n",
    "\n",
    "✗ **Don't use when**:\n",
    "- Drawing without replacement\n",
    "- Correlated events\n",
    "- Sequential dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Two dice**: Are \"first die is even\" and \"second die is odd\" independent?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cards**: Draw 2 cards with replacement. Are \"first is Ace\" and \"second is King\" independent?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overbooking**: Airline has 100 seats, sells 105 tickets, $p=0.95$. Find $P(\\text{overbooked})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DNA database**: 50,000 records, match probability $10^{-5}$. Find $P(\\text{at least one false positive})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **System reliability**: 5 independent components, each with reliability 0.98. Find system reliability if:\n",
    "   - All must work (series)\n",
    "   - At least one must work (parallel)\n",
