    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment**: Process with uncertain outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Space** ($\\Omega$): Set of all possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event**: Subset of sample space\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability**: $P(A)$ where $0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axioms of Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $P(A) \\geq 0$ for any event $A$\n",
    "2. $P(\\Omega) = 1$\n",
    "3. For disjoint events: $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$\n",
