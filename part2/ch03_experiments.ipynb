    "\n",
    "**Probability** is the machinery we use to describe and account for the fact that some outcomes are more frequent than others. We will perform experiments—which could be pretty much anything, from flipping a coin, to eating too much saturated fat, to smoking, to crossing the road without looking—and reason about the outcomes (mostly bad for the examples I gave). But these outcomes are uncertain, and we need to weigh those uncertainties against one another.\n",

    "## What is an Experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you repeat the same experiment numerous times. You do not necessarily expect to see the same result each time. Some results might occur more frequently than others. We account for this tendency using probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we need to be clear about what results an experiment can have. For example, you flip a coin. We might agree that the only possible results are a **head** or a **tail**, thus ignoring the possibilities that:\n",
    "- A bird swoops down and steals the coin\n",
    "- The coin lands and stays on edge  \n",
    "- The coin falls between the cracks in the floor and disappears\n",
    "- And so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing so, we have **idealized the experiment**.\n",

    "### Examples of Experiments\n",

    "1. **Sample Space (Ω)**: Set of all possible outcomes\n",
    "2. **Probability**: Relative frequency of outcomes in many repetitions\n",
    "3. **Normalization**: All probabilities sum to 1\n",
    "4. **Equally Likely Outcomes**: $P = \\frac{1}{|\\Omega|}$\n",
    "5. **Law of Large Numbers**: Observed frequencies converge to true probabilities\n",

    "| Probability of certainty | $P(\\Omega) = 1$ |\n",
    "| Probability of impossibility | $P(\\emptyset) = 0$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Confusing outcomes with events** (we'll see events in the next section)\n",
    "2. **Assuming all outcomes are equally likely** when they're not\n",
    "3. **Forgetting that sample spaces can be infinite**\n",
    "4. **Gambler's fallacy**: Past outcomes don't affect future outcomes in independent experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coin Flips**: You flip a fair coin 5 times. Write out the complete sample space. How many outcomes are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loaded Die**: A die is loaded so that P(6) = 1/2 and all other faces are equally likely. What is P(3)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Three Children**: A family has three children. Write the sample space for the genders of the children. If boys and girls are equally likely, what is P(all same gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convergence**: Write a simulation that flips a fair coin and plots how the observed P(H) converges to 0.5 as the number of flips increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Birthday Problem**: In a room of 23 people, what is the probability that at least two share a birthday? (We'll solve this properly in the next section!)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Continue to [3.2 Events](ch03_events.md) to learn about sets of outcomes and event probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Return to [Chapter 3 Overview](chapter03.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: Understanding sample spaces and probability as relative frequency is the foundation of all probability theory. Every statement about probability ultimately traces back to counting outcomes in many repetitions of an experiment."
